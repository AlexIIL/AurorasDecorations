Blackboards are blocks which you can draw on with dyes.
They come in two variants: blackboard and chalkboard (green).

They also can be worn as masks on the helmet slot, and on a dedicated slot if [Trinkets] is present.

### Copy

You can copy a blackboard's content onto another blackboard by combining a drawn blackboard and an empty blackboard in a crafting grid.

## Drawing

To draw on a blackboard use a [dye][dyes] on blackboard in-game,
it will color the targeted pixel.
You can shade a pixel using bone meal to lighten it, or coal to darken it.

To draw multiple things at once, you can hold in your off-hand:
 - a white wool to use a "brush".
 - a bucket to fill an area.
 - an ender-pearl to replace a color.
 - a stick to draw lines.

To erase a blackboard you can either:
 - put it in water
 - use a water bucket on it
 - use a water potion on it, will consume the water in the bottle
 - place a non-waxed blackboard in water

You also can erase a single pixel with paper.

A blackboard can be glow in the dark if a glow ink sac is used on it, to stop the glow a normal ink sac can be used.

Once you are satisfied with your drawing you can use wax it using honeycomb, either by right-clicking it or by using a smithing table.
Waxed blackboards are made uneditable.
